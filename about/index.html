  <h1 class="about-header">Hello.</h1>
  <p class="about-body">I'm Tom. I'm from Philadelphia, PA and I have a Computer Science degree from Rutgers-Camden â€“ I also studied human-computer interaction at Virginia Tech for 3 years. I've been a gamer since as far back as I can remember which is why you'll probably see a number of gaming-related posts on my blog. These days I'm playing Hearthstone when I find the time. When I'm not gaming I'm usually tinkering with the latest JavaScript frameworks or learning more about design.</p>
  <p class="about-body">You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/itstomedyall" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tdehart" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, or you can simply <a href="mailto:&#116;&#100;&#101;&#104;&#097;&#114;&#116;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">drop me an email.</a></p>
