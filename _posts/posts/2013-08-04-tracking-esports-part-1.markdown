excerpt: Part 1 - Introduction

[Esports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_sports) (competitive video gaming) has been pretty big in [South Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_e-Sports_Association) for a while. The industry was worth [$1.2 billion](http://esportsdigest.com/starcraft-2/editorial-the-legitimacy-of-esports-and-the-dreamhack-open-2013/) in Korea alone last year. They have multiple cable [TV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongamenet) [channels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBCGame) dedicated to watching other people play video games, and talented players often make [six figure salaries](http://www.businessinsider.com/a-look-inside-the-earnings-of-a-top-ranked-professional-starcraft-ii-player-2012-6). Esports is also starting to grow in both the US and Europe thanks to game developers like [Riot](http://www.riotgames.com/), [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/), and [Blizzard](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/) investing their own money into big tournaments like the [League Championship Series](http://competitive.na.leagueoflegends.com/article/season-3-league-legends-championship-series), [The International](http://www.dota2.com/international/home/overview/), and the [World Championship Series](http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en). Combined with these official venues, tournaments like [GSL](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/GOMTV_Global_StarCraft_II_League), [DreamHack](http://www.dreamhack.se/splash/), [WCG](http://us.wcg.com/), and other various events award millions of dollars every year to the best teams and players. 

Starcraft II: HotS had [more than 150 events](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Premier_Tournaments) this past year and that's not even counting the weekly/monthly tournaments that happen regularly. Other major games like League of Legends and Dota 2 see a similar number of events which creates quite an active competitive scene. So where does this leave the average spectator? It's tough to keep up with one game, let alone 2 or more. [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/), a streaming service for gaming, is about the closest thing we have right now to a centralized place for tournaments but their interface is not designed for keeping track of events, and just lists streams in their order of popularity. There are a couple websites, like the [Team Liquid calendar](http://www.teamliquid.net/calendar/â€Ž) for StarCraft and the [EsportsCalendar](http://esportcalendar.com/) for League of Legends, but many competitive games don't have such services; not to mention I have to check a different website for every game that I want to watch.

I'm fond of the notion that you should [work on a problem you experience yourself](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html). So I'm creating a service that aggregates all tournament information in one place, for **all** games. Users can 'follow' their favorite games, tournaments, teams, or players to gain access to a personal feed of just the information they want. Instead of slogging through various calendar sites and filtering out the uninteresting events you will have just the important stuff in a clean, simple format. The development of this project, which I'm currently calling 'eSports Tracker', is still underway but if you want more details feel free to contact me. In my next post I'll talk about the various features of eSports Tracker (seriously I need a better name, let me know if you think of one!) including stat tracking and the promotion of less popular games.
